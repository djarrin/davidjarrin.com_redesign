                <p>I am from…well I am from San Antonio Texas, Bowie Maryland, Sierra Vista Arizona and back 
                    to Maryland (I am currently living in Baltimore Maryland). As a kid I moved around a lot and 
                    have seen many different landscapes and met people from all over the country with a variety of 
                    dialects, political leanings and personalities. I believe it is important to have a diverse 
                    understanding of the world when you are creating something that can be viewed by all of it!</p>
            
                <p>My hobbies include enjoying the music scene that Baltimore has to offer (the 8x10 is my favorite 
                    venue in the city) having a few brews with friends and occasionally enjoying a music festival 
                    at some far corner of the country.</p>
